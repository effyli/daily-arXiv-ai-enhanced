People often combine multiple activities, such as dropping\nkids off at school, commuting to work, and grocery shopping, while seeking\nopportunities to meet others. To address this need, we propose a novel query\ntype, the Trip-based Group Nearest Neighbor (T-GNN) query, which identifies the\noptimal meetup Point of Interest (POI) that aligns with users' existing trips.\nAn individual trip consists of a sequence of locations, allowing users the\nflexibility to detour to the meetup POI at any location within the sequence,\nknown as a detour location. Given a set of trips for the users, the query\nidentifies the optimal meetup POI (e.g., restaurants or movie theaters) and\ndetour locations from each user's trip that minimize the total trip overhead\ndistance. The trip overhead distance refers to the additional distance a user\nmust travel to visit the meetup POI before returning to the next location in\ntheir trip. The sum of these overhead distances for all users constitutes the\ntotal trip overhead distance. The computation time for processing T-GNN queries\nincreases with the number of POIs. To address this, we introduce three\ntechniques to prune the POIs that cannot contribute to the optimal solution,\nand thus refine the search space. We also develop an efficient approach for\nprocessing T-GNN queries in real-time. Extensive experiments validate the\nperformance of the proposed algorithm."}

Further, we argue that in contexts where a\nmodel's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of\nperformance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the\nparticular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast\nwith other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which\nmodels, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated\nas signs. In addition to proposing the framework, we illustrate its empirical\nuse with a few brief examples and consider foundational questions and future\ndirections enabled by the framework."}

To show that modern technology enables the adoption of an\ninclusive schema-and-base conceptual modelling approach, which in turn enables\nmore automated, and empirically motivated practices.

We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided\nExploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to\ndynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task\ndifficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal\nto modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is\nstruggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for\neasier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty.\nExperiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show\nthat DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines.

Following a\nPOMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples,\nsuch as state, observation, agent actions, and mental states, which can be\nautomatically induced from free-form narratives or other inputs. We first show\nS3AP can help LLMs better understand social narratives across 5 social\nreasoning tasks (e.g., +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning\nwith OpenAI's o1), reaching new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We then\ninduce social world models from these structured representations, demonstrating\ntheir ability to predict future social dynamics and improve agent\ndecision-making, yielding up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social\ninteraction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a\npowerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the\ndevelopment of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social\ninteractions."}

Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research\nhas increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing\ntextual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast\ndiscrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal\narchitectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other,\nresulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address\nthis modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment\nfor LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting\nframework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw\ntime series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive\nstatistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt,\nproducing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context\nalignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling\nstrategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual\nembeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the\naligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together\nintegrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show\nthat, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability\nto harness complementary information from text and time series.

Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to\nenhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment.\nTo address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a\nnew LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces\nboth legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce\nLegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide\nthe model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual\npremises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach\nensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation.\nExperiments on two real-world and open-source Chinese legal case datasets\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models."}

To\novercome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent\ncollaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor\nentities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate\nanchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes\nindependent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from\neach candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval\nstrategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge\npaths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework\nimproves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or\nerroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate\nthat AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new\nstate-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks."}

This requires only one additional forward pass per\nsample. To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome\nSensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model\npredictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical\ndeduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness\nby up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process\nsupervision, with only minor accuracy loss. The learned sensitivity generalizes\nto larger models and synergizes with inference-time methods such as\nself-consistency. A pilot study on HellaSwag further demonstrates that\nextending CSR with semantic perturbations can enhance faithfulness in\ncommonsense reasoning."}

While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary\nobjective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In\nRAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,\nwith only a small subset directly relevant to the query.

To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver\nfor the constrained 3D Packing Problem.

This overconfidence, especially in models\nundergone Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), poses significant\nchallenges for reliable uncertainty estimation and safe deployment. In this\npaper, we propose EAGLE (Expectation of AGgregated internaL bEief), a novel\nself-evaluation-based calibration method that leverages the internal hidden\nstates of LLMs to derive more accurate confidence scores. Instead of relying on\nthe model's final output, our approach extracts internal beliefs from multiple\nintermediate layers during self-evaluation. By aggregating these layer-wise\nbeliefs and calculating the expectation over the resulting confidence score\ndistribution, EAGLE produces a refined confidence score that more faithfully\nreflects the model's internal certainty. Extensive experiments on diverse\ndatasets and LLMs demonstrate that EAGLE significantly improves calibration\nperformance over existing baselines.

Based on the urgency of identifying\nAI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel\nbenchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first\nconstruct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six\nprofessional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.\nSubsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on\nthis dataset.

To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose\nReward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an\nexternal reward model to provide a principled global signal during the\niterative diffusion process.

Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract\nnews semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,\nstylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues\ncan easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in\ndynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news\nlandscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective\nby incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and\nsemantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one\ncan deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than\nthe surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose\nGraph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,\nwhich models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via\ngraph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and\nintent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context\ninteraction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and\nimplementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve\nbetter alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic\npathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and\naggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive\nexperiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

However,\nprocessing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and\ndemands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced\nthroughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system\nefficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary\nobjective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In\nRAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,\nwith only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often\nexhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during\nre-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those\nin standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most\ncomputations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be\neliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,\nan efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve\nlatency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we\ndemonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to\nprevious work) without loss in perplexity.

The result is notable: the two texts, translated 94 years\napart using the same method--by Pucci in 1931 and by AIs in 2025--show a low\naverage difference, with only minor variations observed. With Pucci's system\nthus validated, it became feasible to have the AIs reproduce the excerpts in\nEnglish, Spanish, and German according to his method. The results were\nconsistent, and Pucci--via Artificial Intelligence--was tasked with translating\nmore modern and technical texts, thereby reviving, nearly a century later, an\ninvention that had remained almost entirely unknown and never applied beyond\nits creator, now brought to wider attention and opened to possible\nexperimentation. Such a demonstration would not only affirm Pucci's historical\nstatus but also place him among the precursors and intellectual contributors to\nmachine translation, whose work merits examination alongside figures such as\nTroyanskij, Booth, and Weaver, with possible consequences for how the history\nof the field is understood."}
