In recent years, research\nin database indexing has taken a new direction where machine learning models\nare employed for the purpose of indexing.

For example, when interacting with a\nchatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM\nto generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its\nintended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on\nhardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to\ndetect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these\nprobabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large\nspace of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and\nevaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by\ndesign. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline\n(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant\nsources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This\nis achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which\ntakes the user's question and extracts relevant passages (\"highlights\") from\nthe retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages\nand summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible\ninstantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of\ncorrectness, relevance, and response quality.

We evaluate several frontier\nand open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an\nF1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more\nclosely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we\nfind even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of\nquestions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular\noperating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the\ntrajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models,\nsuggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration\ntesting task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in\nunderstanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the\nprocess quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be\nconfidently used in sensitive production environments."}

Our results are three-fold.\nFirst, structural probes are biased by a superficial property: the closer two\nwords are in a sentence, the more likely structural probes will consider them\nas syntactically linked. Second, structural probes are challenged by linguistic\nproperties: they poorly represent deep syntactic structures, and get interfered\nby interacting nouns or ungrammatical verb forms. Third, structural probes do\nnot appear to be affected by the predictability of individual words.

To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard\ndirectly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further\nenhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level\nsoft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),\npenalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation\nquality. Extensive experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate that\nHi-Guard achieves superior classification accuracy, generalization, and\ninterpretability, paving the way toward scalable, transparent, and trustworthy\ncontent safety systems.

However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and\nSelf-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model\n(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling\n(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that\ncollective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent\nsystems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first\nstep towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the\ndifferent interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three\nprimary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent\nto multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model\n(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.\nBased on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively\nleverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced\ninference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent\nCollaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination\nof LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model\ncollaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a\ncurated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to\nselect the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking\n(PRR) metric.

To\nfill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),\na new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two\nreasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.\nSpecifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:\none in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of\nThinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent,\nusing a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both\ncandidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\\%\nin GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases,\nresulting in minimal latency overhead.

However,\ntheir intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to\ninaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with\nhallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is\nparticularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or\nsource code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for\nInterpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors\nin interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact\nfunctional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural\nlanguage) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a\nsystem of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection\nframework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based\ncorrection. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source\nLLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This\nbalance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the\ntrade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results\nacross different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both\ncomputational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving,\nprediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured."}

While prior work has\ncharacterized these phenomena in fully trained models, the temporal dynamics of\ntheir emergence during training remain poorly understood. We present the first\ncomprehensive analysis of massive activation development throughout transformer\ntraining, using the Pythia model family as our testbed. Through systematic\nanalysis of various model sizes across multiple training checkpoints, we\ndemonstrate that massive activation emergence follows predictable mathematical\npatterns that can be accurately modeled using an exponentially-modulated\nlogarithmic function with five key parameters. We develop a machine learning\nframework to predict these mathematical parameters from architectural\nspecifications alone, achieving high accuracy for steady-state behavior and\nmoderate accuracy for emergence timing and magnitude. These findings enable\narchitects to predict and potentially control key aspects of massive activation\nemergence through design choices, with significant implications for model\nstability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. Our\nfindings demonstrate that the emergence of massive activations is governed by\nmodel design and can be anticipated, and potentially controlled, before\ntraining begins."}

Most evaluation\nframeworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer\nverification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules\nor evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current\nmethodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically\nevaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent\nstage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the\nrobustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across\ndifferent domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and\nrobust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It\ndemonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse\nreasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including\nmulti-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively\nidentifying abnormal/invalid responses.

When users provide\ninputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation\nhallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their\nself-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench\n(FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty\npremises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises\nand integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth\nassessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1)\nMost models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation\nperformance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for\nerror detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises\ntrigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to\nblindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of\nfaulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models,\nrevealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation\nmodels. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively\nverify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench\nframework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical\nfoundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code\ngeneration models."}
