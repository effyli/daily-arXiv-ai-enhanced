Among these,\nSFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into\nstructured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly\nestablished methodology for effective training data selection. Simply\nincreasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,\nwhile preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and\ncost.\n  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been\nproposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable\ntraining data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods\ntypically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and\nincurring additional costs for prompt design.\n  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal\nRepresentations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by\nanalyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes\nsimilarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final\nhidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that\nwere largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide\nrange of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.\nMoreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity\nwith the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.\nExperiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less\nfamiliar data leads to better generalization performance."}

These models operate with a thinking\nbudget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a\nsolution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator\nframework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model\nperiodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a\nconfident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty\nthreshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability\nby allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging\nfurther reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the\nAIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)\nimproves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended\nmulti-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing\nvariance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based\ngrading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate\nmillions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty\nthresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a\npowerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the\nreasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,\ntrustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in\ndomains where both accuracy and computational cost matter."}

Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal Representations", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by\npretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these,\nSFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into\nstructured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly\nestablished methodology for effective training data selection. Simply\nincreasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,\nwhile preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and\ncost.\n  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been\nproposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable\ntraining data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods\ntypically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and\nincurring additional costs for prompt design.\n  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal\nRepresentations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by\nanalyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes\nsimilarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final\nhidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that\nwere largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide\nrange of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.\nMoreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity\nwith the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.\nExperiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less\nfamiliar data leads to better generalization performance."}

By leveraging graph signal\nprocessing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian\neigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the\ninterpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of\nspectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive\nset of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and\ndiffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts\nfor modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and\nuncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements\nsuch as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,\nadversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and\ncausal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.\n  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as\nProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior\naccuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,\nand higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including\ntransformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic\nprogramming systems.
