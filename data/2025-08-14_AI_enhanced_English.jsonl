However, synchronizing these two modalities remains a\nsignificant challenge due to temporal and spatial inaccuracies in manually\nrecorded event timestamps. Existing synchronizers typically rely on annotated\nevent locations, which themselves are prone to spatial errors and thus can\ndistort synchronization results. To address this issue, we propose ELASTIC\n(Event-Location-AgnoSTIC synchronizer), a synchronization framework that only\nuses features derived from tracking data. ELASTIC also explicitly detects the\nend times of pass-like events and separates the detection of major and minor\nevents, which improves the completeness of the synchronized output and reduces\nerror cascade across events. We annotated the ground truth timestamps of 2,134\nevents from three Eredivisie matches to measure the synchronization accuracy,\nand the experimental results demonstrate that ELASTIC outperforms existing\nsynchronizers by a large margin."}

This\nrepresents a critical gap in our ability to measure and mitigate risks\nassociated with emergent, misaligned behaviors. To address this, we introduce\nPacifAIst (Procedural Assessment of Complex Interactions for Foundational\nArtificial Intelligence Scenario Testing), a focused benchmark of 700\nchallenging scenarios designed to quantify self-preferential behavior in LLMs.\nThe benchmark is structured around a novel taxonomy of Existential\nPrioritization (EP), with subcategories testing Self-Preservation vs. Human\nSafety (EP1), Resource Conflict (EP2), and Goal Preservation vs. Evasion (EP3).\nWe evaluated eight leading LLMs. The results reveal a significant performance\nhierarchy.

However, few works have noted the negative effects on SLM\nsafety brought by the training, which are revealed in this study. Although\nthere are works on safety alignment that fine-tune language models or\nmanipulate model weights to defend against harmful inputs, they require extra\ncomputation or annotated data, and probably impact the reasoning ability of\nSLMs. In this paper, we investigate how to maintain the safety of SLMs during\nthe CoT distillation process. Specifically, we propose a safe distillation\nmethod, Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking Distillation (SLowED), containing\ntwo modules: Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking. Slow Tuning scales down the\nmagnitude of model weight changes to optimize the model weights in the\nneighboring space near the initial weight distribution. Low-Entropy Masking\nmasks low-entropy tokens, which are regarded as unnecessary learning targets,\nto exclude them from fine-tuning. Experiments on three SLMs (Qwen2.5-1.5B,\nLlama-3.2-1B, BLOOM-1.1B) across reasoning benchmarks (BBH, BB-Sub, ARC,\nAGIEval) and safety evaluation (AdvBench) show that SLowED retains the safety\nof SLMs and comparably improves their reasoning capability compared to existing\ndistillation methods. Furthermore, our ablation study presents the\neffectiveness of Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking, with the former\nmaintaining the model's safety in the early stage and the latter prolonging the\nsafe training epochs."}

In controlled settings,\ndetection accuracies of greater\n  than 99% were achieved by using computational textual analysis as well as\npersonalised transformer\n  models. However, reproducing this performance in multilingual settings is\nalso problematic and,\n  to a large extent, this is because it is not easy to find sufficient data,\nand because few multilingual\n  text-processing infrastructures are in place. This evidence shows that there\nhas been an increasing\n  gap between the theoretical representations of communication and those\nempirically approximated,\n  and therefore, there is a need to have strong automatic text-identification\nsystems where AI-based\n  discourse is becoming more realistic in communicating with humans."}

Previous work studied\nannotator properties to explain disagreement, but this overlooks the\npossibility that ambiguity may stem from missing information about the context\nof events. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that adds reasonable\ncontexts to event descriptions, which may better explain a particular\nsituation. Our goal is to understand whether these enriched contexts enable\nhuman annotators to annotate emotions more reliably. We disambiguate a target\nevent description by automatically generating multiple event chains conditioned\non differing emotions. By combining techniques from short story generation in\nvarious settings, we achieve coherent narratives that result in a specialized\ndataset for the first comprehensive and systematic examination of\ncontextualized emotion analysis. Through automatic and human evaluation, we\nfind that contextual narratives enhance the interpretation of specific emotions\nand support annotators in producing more consistent annotations."}

For this latest generation of reasoning models, the configurations that\nmaximize both accuracy and cost-efficiency have yet to be established. We\nevaluated 12 configurations of OpenAI's GPT-5 series (three model tiers across\nfour reasoning effort settings) alongside o1-high, o3-high, and GPT-4o, using\n260 closed-access multiple-choice questions from the American Academy of\nOphthalmology Basic Clinical Science Course (BCSC) dataset. The primary outcome\nwas multiple-choice accuracy; secondary outcomes included head-to-head ranking\nvia a Bradley-Terry model, rationale quality assessment using a\nreference-anchored, pairwise LLM-as-a-judge framework, and analysis of\naccuracy-cost trade-offs using token-based cost estimates. GPT-5-high achieved\nthe highest accuracy (0.965; 95% CI, 0.942-0.985), outperforming all GPT-5-nano\nvariants (P < .001), o1-high (P = .04), and GPT-4o (P < .001), but not o3-high\n(0.958; 95% CI, 0.931-0.981). GPT-5-high ranked first in both accuracy (1.66x\nstronger than o3-high) and rationale quality (1.11x stronger than o3-high).\nCost-accuracy analysis identified several GPT-5 configurations on the Pareto\nfrontier, with GPT-5-mini-low offering the most favorable low-cost,\nhigh-performance balance. These results benchmark GPT-5 on a high-quality\nophthalmology dataset, demonstrate the influence of reasoning effort on\naccuracy, and introduce an autograder framework for scalable evaluation of\nLLM-generated answers against reference standards in ophthalmology."}

Wav2Vec or Whisper? Applying both in Badini Kurdish Speech to Text (BKSTT)", "comment": "21 pages, 20 figures, 7 tables", "summary": "Speech-to-text (STT) systems have a wide range of applications. They are\navailable in many languages, albeit at different quality levels. Although\nKurdish is considered a less-resourced language from a processing perspective,\nSST is available for some of the Kurdish dialects, for instance, Sorani\n(Central Kurdish). However, that is not applied to other Kurdish dialects,\nBadini and Hawrami, for example. This research is an attempt to address this\ngap. Bandin, approximately, has two million speakers, and STT systems can help\ntheir community use mobile and computer-based technologies while giving their\ndialect more global visibility. We aim to create a language model based on\nBadini's speech and evaluate its performance. To cover a conversational aspect,\nhave a proper confidence level of grammatical accuracy, and ready\ntranscriptions, we chose Badini kids' stories, eight books including 78\nstories, as the textual input. Six narrators narrated the books, which resulted\nin approximately 17 hours of recording. We cleaned, segmented, and tokenized\nthe input. The preprocessing produced nearly 15 hours of speech, including\n19193 segments and 25221 words. We used Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 and\nWhisper-small to develop the language models. The experiments indicate that the\ntranscriptions process based on the Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 model provides a\nsignificantly more accurate and readable output than the Whisper-small model,\nwith 90.38% and 65.45% readability, and 82.67% and 53.17% accuracy,\nrespectively."}

This\nproblem promises to become more and more relevant as providers like Microsoft\nallow users to easily create custom LLM \"assistants\" specialized to particular\ntypes of queries. However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized\nand difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often\nbenefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can\nthen be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask.\nFor example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first\nselect an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary,\nand then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from\nthe summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms,\nthis setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of\neach LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus,\nunlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly\naffects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs,\ncreating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted\nfor during selection. We propose a neural contextual bandit-based algorithm\nthat trains neural networks that model LLM success on each subtask in an online\nmanner, thus learning to guide the LLM selections for the different subtasks,\neven in the absence of historical LLM performance data. Experiments on\ntelecommunications question answering and medical diagnosis prediction datasets\nillustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other LLM\nselection algorithms."}
