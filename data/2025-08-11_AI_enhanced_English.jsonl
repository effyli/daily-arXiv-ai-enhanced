A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding\nnatural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which\naccurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a\ncorrect semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally\nappropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards\n(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these\nMLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,\nwhich prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address\nthis exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization\n(AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer\ngeneration strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a\ntheoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from\nfirst principles of efficiency eta=U/C.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by\nretrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM\nreasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the\nrelational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable\nperformance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG)\nmethods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph,\nintroducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world\nqueries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for\naccurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required\nstructures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we\npropose a \\textbf{\\underline{Logic}}-aware\n\\textbf{\\underline{R}}etrieval-\\textbf{\\underline{A}}ugmented\n\\textbf{\\underline{G}}eneration framework (\\textbf{LogicRAG}) that dynamically\nextracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval\nwithout any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query\ninto a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to\nmodel the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step\nreasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that\nsubproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG\napplies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to\nfilter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior\nperformance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

(2) A comprehensive 14-scenario dataset\nwith diverse jailbreak variants and regional cases, filling the long-standing\ngap in high-quality, holistic benchmarks for scenario-adaptive evaluation. (3)\nSceneJailEval achieves state-of-the-art results, with an F1 score of 0.917 on\nour full-scenario dataset (+6% over prior SOTA) and 0.995 on JBB (+3% over\nprior SOTA), surpassing accuracy limits of existing evaluation methods in\nheterogeneous scenarios and confirming its advantage."}

While previous multimodal\nresearch has focused primarily on vision and audio, haptic signals for the\nsense of touch remain underexplored. To address this gap, we formalize the\nhaptic captioning task and propose HapticLLaMA, a multimodal sensory language\nmodel that interprets vibration signals into descriptions in a given sensory,\nemotional, or associative category. We investigate two types of haptic\ntokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that\nconvert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their\nintegration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1)\nsupervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation,\nand (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We\nassess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics\nand human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in\ninterpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a\nBLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated\ncaptions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF\nyielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating\nstronger alignment with human haptic perception. These findings highlight the\npotential of large language models to process and adapt to sensory data."}
