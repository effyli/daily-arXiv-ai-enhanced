For example, a model that can change a variable name like\nuserIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index\nwithout reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and\ndiscovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned\non forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability\nto reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse. To address this issue,\nthey developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT), which trains models using three\ntypes of examples: positive examples that maintain semantic meaning, negative\nexamples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples.\nThis approach aims to develop deeper understanding rather than surface-level\npattern recognition and allows reverse capabilities to develop naturally\nwithout explicit reverse training.

To address these issues, this paper presents\nMSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that\nintegrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow\nheterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution\nto extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies\nscale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of\nroad networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,\nMSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple\nscales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,\nwhich are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road\nnetwork representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that\nMSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks.

For questions that are similar in a general-specific\nsense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the\nquestion and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The\nLLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing\nit to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition.

One\nsuch application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and\nreasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development\nof native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling\nand Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up\npre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an\nautonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on\ncontext, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training\nrecipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement\nlearning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills\nwhile preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL\nrecipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source\nLLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam\nbenchmark.

The second innovation is a planner-enhanced\nmulti-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference\ntime. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level\nplanner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler\nsubgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,\nenabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by\nleveraging a shared proof cache.

We\ntested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark\ndesigned to diagnose the \"who\" (agent) and \"when\" (step) of a system's failure.\nRAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair\naccuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial\nincrease from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the\nHand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These\nresults demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection\nfor autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review."}

Under PCN, numeric\nspans are emitted as \\emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a\nverifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality,\nrounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places\nverification in the \\emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers\nare marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation\nprevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and\nprove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and\nmonotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic,\nintegrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with\ncryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before\ndisplay, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings:\n\\emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates\nuncertainty."}

Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches\noperate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build\nenvironmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited\nerror recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment\nfor the automotive domain, featuring 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties\nwith fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information\nduring agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle\nagent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic\nanalysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function\ncalling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose\nState-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit\nsystem state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve\ntarget conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly\noutperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy\nand reduced latency.

Evaluation capabilities that\ncurrently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that\nthey often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes,\nand are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match\nthe agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason,\nprobe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems\nover long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation\narchitecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.\nSpecifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using\na central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized\nEvaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of\nthe reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We\ntested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark\ndesigned to diagnose the \"who\" (agent) and \"when\" (step) of a system's failure.\nRAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair\naccuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial\nincrease from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the\nHand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These\nresults demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection\nfor autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review."}

However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective\nfor knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low\nhallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of\ntest-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive\nbenchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not\nconsistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more\nhallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination\nbehavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model\nchoosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual\nrecall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on\npreviously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case\nstudies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to\noverconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that\ncompared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data\nare available at https://github.com/XuZhao0/tts-knowledge"}

Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive\nartifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and\ndiscovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial\neffort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own\nwork, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this\nchallenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a\nknowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the\nassociated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol\n(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify\nthe resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat\nagent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through\nnatural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We\ndemonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper\nagents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that\nleverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy\nand TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We\nvalidate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and\ncan correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into\ndynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for\nknowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI\nco-scientists."}
