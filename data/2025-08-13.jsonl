Previous\ntheoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal\nsequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all\ncontinuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings\nof tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures\nfor LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as\nfunctions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have\nfocused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this\npaper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM\narchitectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,\nthese new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM\ncategories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential\nobjects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new\ncompositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,\nmeaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on\nthis completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,\na ``set-like\" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential\nobjects as well as subobject classifiers.

The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are\ncentral to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject\nclassifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which\ncreates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary\ncomplexity to be ``solved\", using a novel interpretation of causal\napproximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes\nof operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal\nhomotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a\ncollection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous\" causal mechanism\nthat assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous\nvariables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this\npaper, every causal diagram has a ``solution\" in the form of a (co)limit: this\nimplies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated\" by some global\nfunction with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.\nNatural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.\nIn addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject\nclassifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.\nExponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal\nequivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an\ninternal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated\nKripke-Joyal semantics.

Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we\npropose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to\npredict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We\nfurther perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each\nfactor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including\nover 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good\nperformance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high\nexplainability."}

In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected\nRAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,\nthus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of\nsemantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant\nknowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of\nanonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two\nkey challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted\ninto retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous\nentities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric\nabstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies.

We validate our\napproach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B,\nand 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic\nvalidity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over\nbaseline.

In contrast, many common\ntherapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective\ntriggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by\nthis, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for\nmistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as\nstandards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then\nconstructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes\nduring interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies\nmistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset,\nthe final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training.

To address this challenge,\nwe propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait\nelicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are\nformed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates\nand optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises\nself-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior.

Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up\nto 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within\n1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant\nacceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a\ngroundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way\nfor its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered\ncustomer service bots and answer retrieval engines."}

One weakness of MCTS is\nthat it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While\nselecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity\nwith traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the\ntree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\\log N)$, which roughly\ncorresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily\nlarge (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node\nselection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is\nnegligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently\nlimited by the game (e.g., $d\\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we\npropose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each\nselected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves\namortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional\nqueue-based OPEN list.

While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load\nimportant tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to\naddress the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In\nthis paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that\nretrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries\nfrom subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,\nRetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant\ncontext, while incurring minimal latency overhead.
