Drawing from cognitive science foundations\nincluding Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and\nHutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive\nretrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human\nmemory management.

Empirical validation demonstrates\nCognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from\n54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%\nnet efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts.

This\npaper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the\nmethodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,\nvalidation methods, and correlations with human judgment.

Datarus is trained not on isolated\nquestion-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning\nsteps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,\nall captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,\nnumerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline\ncombines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000\ntagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight\ntag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores\nboth single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a\nmemory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\nfeaturing KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.\nA cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to\nsemantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague\nRL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning\ninterface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke\nPython tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On\ndemanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an \"AHA-moment\"\npattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges\navoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.\nAcross standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and\neven reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up\nto 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting\n18-49% fewer tokens per solution."}

Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited\ncultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning\napproaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association\nnorms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and\nMandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt\nLlama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based\npreference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by\n16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,\nand attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on\nWorld-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions\ntoward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's\nChinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our\n7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million\nculture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly\nretraining.

To\naddress this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)\nframework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping\nthem with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before\ndecision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)\nreward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the\namount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated\nvia Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)\nSIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to\nconstruct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)\nSIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a\nnovel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to\ninformative questions for targeted optimization.

Our results show that deterministic\nstrategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the\nhighest scores, while {\\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding\nmethods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores\noverall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding.\nSurprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five\ntasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals\ngreater sensitivity to decoding choice.

This paper examines\ncommon methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are\ncore elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve\nmapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,\nknown as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these\nsemantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain\nthe corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that\nprediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based\ninterpretability.\n  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,\nconcluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic\nupper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word\nembeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on\nprediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better\ncaptured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings\nprimarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than\nindicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties."}

This\npaper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the\nmethodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,\nvalidation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several\nkey challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,\ntheir effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain\nunstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.\nImportantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of\nmetric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry.
