Most existing graph-based\nindexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the\ndata after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,\ndeletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in\napplications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently\nsupports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based\nindexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query\nquality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to\nmaintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve\nthese problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main\ncomponents: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to\ncombat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood\nconsolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory\ncleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the\nwork spent by the first two components.

This combined insight\nsourced from both intellectual property and real world product data enables R&D\nteams to assess not only technical novelty but also feasibility, scalability,\nand sustainability.

We examine how different aspects of the\nfine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data,\nusing the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events.\n  Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to\ndetect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess\nverbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight\nmatrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity\nand memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation\n(LoRA) fine-tuning.\n  Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more\nsignificantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower\nperplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3)\nHigher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns\nat higher ranks.\n  These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance\nand privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for\ndeveloping more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large\nlanguage models while managing data privacy concerns.", "AI": {"tldr": "This study explores how fine-tuning large language models in the medical domain can lead to memorization, impacting privacy and performance.", "motivation": "To understand the factors influencing memorization in fine-tuned LLMs, especially given the privacy-sensitive nature of medical data.", "method": "Using membership inference attacks, generation tasks, and analysis of different transformer components and LoRA ranks.", "result": "Identified key matrices contributing to memorization, a correlation between perplexity and memorization, and effects of LoRA rank increases.", "conclusion": "Findings highlight the trade-offs between model performance and privacy, informing future strategies for responsible model fine-tuning."}}

As real human evaluator resources are often scarce and\ncostly, the emerging \"LLM-as-a-judge\" paradigm sheds light on a promising\napproach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet,\nto date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona\ndescriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are\nnot generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose\nMAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically\nconstruct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant\ntext documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the\npersonas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate\nmulti-dimensional feedback.
