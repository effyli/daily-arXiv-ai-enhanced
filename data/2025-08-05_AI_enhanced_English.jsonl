However, enforcing content restrictions remains a\nsignificant challenge due to their expansive output space. One aspect of\ncontent restriction is preventing LLMs from generating harmful content via\nmodel alignment approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Yet, the need\nfor content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change\nrapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of\nharmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical\ndue to the high computational, data, and storage demands. Motivated by this\nneed, we propose a new task called \\textit{Adaptive Content Restriction}\n(AdaCoRe), which focuses on lightweight strategies -- methods without model\nfine-tuning -- to prevent deployed LLMs from generating restricted terms for\nspecific use cases. We propose the first method for AdaCoRe, named\n\\textit{Suffix Optimization (SOP)}, which appends a short, optimized suffix to\nany prompt to a) prevent a target LLM from generating a set of restricted\nterms, while b) preserving the output quality. To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches,\nincluding our SOP, we create a new \\textit{Content Restriction Benchmark}\n(CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8\ncarefully selected categories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SOP on\nCoReBench, which outperforms the system-level baselines such as system suffix\nby 15\\%, 17\\%, 10\\%, 9\\%, and 6\\% on average restriction rates for Gemma2-2B,\nMistral-7B, Vicuna-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3.1-8B, respectively.

However, some initial findings suggest that CoT\nreasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore\nfurther.

Thus, its effectiveness is\nfundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the\ntraining data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning\nvia three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,\nwe design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs\nfrom scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution\nconditions.

Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with\nLLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various\nplanning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In\nthis paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing\n(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery\npipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along\nwith three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the\nLLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.\nThis pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context\nof AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid\nplans.

Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response\nlength, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the\nreasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it\ninto two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of\nlow-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and\nexternal redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To\nmitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning\nframework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis\nto penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the\ncorrect answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the\nFCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses\nreasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to\nout-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially,\nwe find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading\nperformance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to\navoid impairing correctness.

This\npaper focuses on analyzing mathematics tutoring discourse using talk moves - a\nframework of dialogue acts grounded in Accountable Talk theory. However,\nscaling the collection, annotation, and analysis of extensive tutoring\ndialogues to develop machine learning models is a challenging and\nresource-intensive task. To address this, we present SAGA22, a compact dataset,\nand explore various modeling strategies, including dialogue context, speaker\ninformation, pretraining datasets, and further fine-tuning. By leveraging\nexisting datasets and models designed for classroom teaching, our results\ndemonstrate that supplementary pretraining on classroom data enhances model\nperformance in tutoring settings, particularly when incorporating longer\ncontext and speaker information. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation\nstudies to underscore the challenges in talk move modeling."}

Training CNNs to Classify and Localize Memorization in LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Verbatim memorization in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a multifaceted\nphenomenon involving distinct underlying mechanisms. We introduce a novel\nmethod to analyze the different forms of memorization described by the existing\ntaxonomy. Specifically, we train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the\nattention weights of the LLM and evaluate the alignment between this taxonomy\nand the attention weights involved in decoding.\n  We find that the existing taxonomy performs poorly and fails to reflect\ndistinct mechanisms within the attention blocks. We propose a new taxonomy that\nmaximizes alignment with the attention weights, consisting of three categories:\nmemorized samples that are guessed using language modeling abilities, memorized\nsamples that are recalled due to high duplication in the training set, and\nnon-memorized samples. Our results reveal that few-shot verbatim memorization\ndoes not correspond to a distinct attention mechanism. We also show that a\nsignificant proportion of extractable samples are in fact guessed by the model\nand should therefore be studied separately. Finally, we develop a custom visual\ninterpretability technique to localize the regions of the attention weights\ninvolved in each form of memorization."}

However, utterance-level discourse analysis encounters two\nprimary challenges: (1) multifunctionality, where a single utterance may serve\nmultiple purposes that a single tag cannot capture, and (2) the exclusion of\nmany utterances from domain-specific discourse move classifications, leading to\ntheir omission in feedback. To address these challenges, we proposed a\nmulti-perspective discourse analysis that integrates domain-specific talk moves\nwith dialogue act (using the flattened multi-functional SWBD-MASL schema with\n43 tags) and discourse relation (applying Segmented Discourse Representation\nTheory with 16 relations). Our top-down analysis framework enables a\ncomprehensive understanding of utterances that contain talk moves, as well as\nutterances that do not contain talk moves. This is applied to two mathematics\neducation datasets: TalkMoves (teaching) and SAGA22 (tutoring). Through\ndistributional unigram analysis, sequential talk move analysis, and multi-view\ndeep dive, we discovered meaningful discourse patterns, and revealed the vital\nrole of utterances without talk moves, demonstrating that these utterances, far\nfrom being mere fillers, serve crucial functions in guiding, acknowledging, and\nstructuring classroom discourse. These insights underscore the importance of\nincorporating discourse relations and dialogue acts into AI-assisted education\nsystems to enhance feedback and create more responsive learning environments.\nOur framework may prove helpful for providing human educator feedback, but also\naiding in the development of AI agents that can effectively emulate the roles\nof both educators and students."}

Each sentence\nis annotated with an aspect and sentiment label (positive, negative, or\nneutral), forming a pioneering Arabic dataset aligned with healthcare themes,\nwith ChatGPT-generated rationales provided for each label to enhance\ntransparency. To evaluate the impact of annotation quality on model\nperformance, we created three versions of the training data: a fully supervised\nset with all labels reviewed by humans, a semi-supervised set with 50% human\nreview, and an unsupervised set with only machine-generated labels. We\nfine-tuned two transformer models on these datasets for both aspect and\nsentiment classification. Experimental results show that our Arabic-specific\nmodel achieved high accuracy even with minimal human supervision, reflecting\nonly a minor performance drop when using ChatGPT-only labels.

However,\ncurrent approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve\nunstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations\nthat are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel\nframework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the\nform of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We\nuse a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks\nand semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct\nstructured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable\npathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions,\nproviding a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE\ncan significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models\n(4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior\nmethods for unstructured multi-LLM debates.

A\ncommon conjecture is that language models' reliance on subword units, rather\nthan characters, contributes to their struggles with character-level tasks, yet\nrecent studies offer conflicting conclusions about the role of tokenization,\nleaving its impact unclear. To address this gap, we introduce CharBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark of character-level tasks that is two orders of\nmagnitude larger than existing alternatives. We evaluate a diverse range of\nleading open-weight and proprietary models on CharBench and find that it\npresents a significant challenge to modern LLMs, with an average accuracy of\n43.6% and 32.3% on some tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of how intrinsic\nproperties of words and their segmentations into tokens correspond to model\nperformance. For counting tasks, we find that tokenization properties are\nweakly correlated with correctness, while the length of the queried word and\nthe actual character count play a more significant part. In contrast, for tasks\nrequiring intra-word positional understanding, performance is negatively\ncorrelated with the length of the token containing the queried character,\nsuggesting that longer tokens obscure character position information for LLMs.\nWe encourage future work to build on the benchmark and evaluation methodology\nintroduced here as tools for improving model performance on such tasks."}

This stems from two fundamental limitations: (1) Current preference\nmodeling employs decoder-only architectures, where the unidirectional causal\nattention mechanism leads to forward-decaying intra-sequence attention within\nthe prompt-response sequence.
