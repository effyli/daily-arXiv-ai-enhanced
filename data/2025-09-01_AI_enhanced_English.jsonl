To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of\ncounterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which\nsimultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and\nenhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias\nAugmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:\nfirst decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively\nmodifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the\ntext from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that\nmitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that\nCoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively\nreduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a\nversatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations."}

Forgetting has many\nfacets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a\nconditional.

It has been mainly used in the area of logic\nprogramming and answer set programming.

Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the\nstates are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the\natoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not\nfull STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the\nactions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different\nversions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the\ntraces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all\nobservable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as\nthe atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,\nand the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not\nthe ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the\nlearning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,\nwhere certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions\nwhich can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The\nlearning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+\nstate-action traces.

Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the\nnormal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense\nof the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two\nways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather\nthan exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test\nrequires building machines that \"make mistakes\" and display imperfect behavior\njust like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a\nstatistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a\nsingle \"average\" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As\nsuch, the notion of \"average human interrogator\" that Turing talks about in his\noriginal paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical\nabstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of\nmultiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of\nnormal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average\njudgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,\nit argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the\nTuring test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than\nnormal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it\nproposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per\nse. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can\ncontribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether\nthe human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which\nlargely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual\nunderpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to."}

Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges\nremain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical\nrequirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or\nevaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like\ndiagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce\nMed-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and\njudges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset\nspanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026\nexpert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality\nevaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and\nmedical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs\nwith expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate\nsubstantial performance improvements through fine-tuning."}

We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the\n\"steerability\" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting\nand activation steering.

To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel \\emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.\nSpecifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify\nits core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks\nwith similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming\nclusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:\nfor each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are\ndirectly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from\ndifferent tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation\n(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT\ntraining phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing\ncore regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently\noutperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines."}

Unlike standard language regression\ntasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc\nproblems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much\ndeeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training\ndata and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR\ntasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis\nthat prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient\ndescent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and\nlightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with\nneural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both\nbaselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR."}

The key challenge for reasoning\ntasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning\nchains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic\nConfidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that\nscores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the\nreasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final\nanswer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.\nPiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,\n+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in\n16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains\nexhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the\neffectiveness of PiCSAR."}
