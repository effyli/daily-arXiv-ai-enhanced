To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticData, an\ninnovative agentic data analytics system that allows users to simply pose\nnatural language (NL) questions while autonomously analyzing data sources\nacross multiple domains, including both unstructured and structured data.\nFirst, AgenticData employs a feedback-driven planning technique that\nautomatically converts an NL query into a semantic plan composed of relational\nand semantic operators. We propose a multi-agent collaboration strategy by\nutilizing a data profiling agent for discovering relevant data, a semantic\ncross-validation agent for iterative optimization based on feedback, and a\nsmart memory agent for maintaining short-term context and long-term knowledge.\nSecond, we propose a semantic optimization model to refine and execute semantic\nplans effectively. Our system, AgenticData, has been tested using three\nbenchmarks.

This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime\ncontrol.\n  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a\nlanguage and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts\nstructured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR\nenables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in\nresponse to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing\ncontext; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments\ninto versioned views with support for introspection and logging.\n  SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and\nadapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual,\nassisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and\nautomation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables\noptimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse.\nPreliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes\ncompared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of\nprompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion."}

Therefore,\nlearning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces\nadditional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method\nfocuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues.\nAchieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a\nsignificant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is\nineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization\nalgorithm to partition the dialogues.

A widely held \"cascading\nfailure\" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur\nearly in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through\nsystematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive\nphenomenon we term \"Late-Stage Fragility\": errors introduced in the later\nstages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer\nthan identical errors made at the beginning.

To address this, we\nintroduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on\nMalaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment,\nfood, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks,\nMyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without\npredefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We\nprovide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended\nstructure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we\nanalyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus\nfree-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt\nvariations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs\nreveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the\nurgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in\nthe development and assessment of LLMs."}

However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a\nkey component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting\nposes several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification\nmethods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks\nsuch as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we\nfind that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to\nreward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant\nresponses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the\nfactual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies\nonline RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form\nfactuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average\nreduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in\nanswer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness."}

Linear Probes Can Uncover Persuasion Dynamics in Multi-Turn Conversations", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to\npersuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is\nlimited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing\nmodel representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model\nuser sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to\nstudy persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage\ninsights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of\npersuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.\nDespite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of\npersuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can\nidentify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where\npersuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show\nthat in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,\nprobes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such\nas when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible\navenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and\nmanipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset\nanalysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient."}

We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that\nlearns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key\ninnovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M\nparameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for\ndocument-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts\n(e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence\nlengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art\nresults: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better\ncompression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ\ncorruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks\nalign with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that\nhierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for\nMRLs while maintaining computational efficiency."}
