Previous research has primarily focused\non enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural\ninnovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match\nthe performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that\nthis limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not\nwell-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a\nchunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth\nReading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual\ninformation, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more\ncompatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method\nsubstantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention\nLLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of\nRecurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from\n5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.\nBesides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and\ninferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using\nRecurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope\nour method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further\nprogress, we will release code and dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "Smooth Reading, a chunk-wise inference method for Recurrent LLMs, narrows the performance gap with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks while maintaining efficiency.", "motivation": "Recurrent LLMs are efficient but underperform on long-context tasks compared to Self-Attention LLMs, due to limited memory capabilities.", "method": "Introducing Smooth Reading, a chunk-wise inference approach inspired by human reading, which processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes information.", "result": "Significant performance improvements, with the Recurrent LLM SWA-3B-4k surpassing Self-Attention LLMs by 3.61%, and showing faster training/inferencing speeds; first to achieve such performance parity.", "conclusion": "Smooth Reading effectively enhances Recurrent LLMs for long-context tasks, offering a promising direction for future research."}}
