Our key\ncontribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for\nhigh-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a\ncomputationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,\ncan be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means\nthat inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By\napplying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we\ngenerate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent\nbut is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the\nprompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM\nframework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations."}

Despite remarkable\nprogress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,\npoetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative\nlanguage and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of\n7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615\nwork-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five\ninfluential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned\non this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60\nF1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM\nmodel, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then\non the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify\ntemporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong\ncapacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study\nbridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new\npossibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through\nstructured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of\nKorean literature."}

When humans play poker, they bluff. However, most works on\ncomputer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing\nis overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN\n(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit\nbluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed\nan experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while\nwe log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,\nbut they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at\ndifferent rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)\nis roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the\ngame, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing\nstyles and at the full game of poker.

However, current research lacks both evaluation\nbenchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we\npropose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,\nwhich can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for\nreinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data\nsynthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both\ntextual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning\nBenchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on\nSSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting\nsheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro\nhighlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in\na visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and\nQwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the\ntrained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on\nMusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with\nthe strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on\nmath problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.\nFurthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also\nfacilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the\nidea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and\ndemonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet\nmusic understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted\nmusic creation."}

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such\nas BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT\n(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this\nstudy, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their\ndifferent characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and\nmetrics used to measure their performance.

We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for\ncomprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline\nfor consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +\nActing) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring\ngrounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce\nhallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary\nknowledge base.

In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative\npurpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test\nmodels under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and\n(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity\nacross four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice\nmetrics.
