To\nevaluate MERAI's performance, we compared it with two well-known entity\nresolution libraries, Dedupe and Splink.

To resolve\nthese challenges, we introduce BridgeScope, a universal toolkit bridging LLMs\nand databases through three key innovations.

We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about\nsignificant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to\nencourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious\nand caste representation in the outputs against the actual population\ndistribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and\n\"stickiness\" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste.

To address these challenges, we propose\nEvo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that\nenables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities.

To address this issue, watermarking techniques\nhave emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages\ninto generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent\nefforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich\ninformation such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the\nfundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure\nreliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token\nsets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated\ncontent. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that\nimproves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects\npreferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a\nlarger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that\nrely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a\nclustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even\nwhen the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and\ndecoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the\nmessage into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically\ndecode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text\nand improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs\ndemonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and\ntext generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines."}

The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators\ncreate a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social\nexchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group\nand providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but \"black\nbox\" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues.

However, GraphRAG relies on LLMs to extract knowledge from raw\ntext during graph construction, and this process can be maliciously manipulated\nto implant misleading information. Targeting this attack surface, we propose\ntwo knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) and demonstrate that modifying only a\nfew words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph,\npoison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. The first\nattack, named Targeted KPA (TKPA), utilizes graph-theoretic analysis to locate\nvulnerable nodes in the generated graphs and rewrites the corresponding\nnarratives with LLMs, achieving precise control over specific\nquestion-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1\\%, while keeping\nthe poisoned text fluent and natural. The second attack, named Universal KPA\n(UKPA), exploits linguistic cues such as pronouns and dependency relations to\ndisrupt the structural integrity of the generated graph by altering globally\ninfluential words. With fewer than 0.05\\% of full text modified, the QA\naccuracy collapses from 95\\% to 50\\%.

Recent works like XL-LEXEME have leveraged the\ntask of Word-in-Context to fine-tune them to get more semantically accurate\nrepresentations, but Word-in-Context only compares occurrences of the same\nlemma, limiting the range of captured information. In this paper, we propose an\nextension, Concept Differentiation, to include inter-words scenarios. We\nprovide a dataset for this task, derived from SemCor data. Then we fine-tune\nseveral representation models on this dataset. We call these models\nConcept-Aligned Embeddings (CALE). By challenging our models and other models\non various lexical semantic tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed models\nprovide efficient multi-purpose representations of lexical meaning that reach\nbest performances in our experiments. We also show that CALE's fine-tuning\nbrings valuable changes to the spatial organization of embeddings."}

It\nhighlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the\nsignificant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment,\nespecially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research\nintroduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1\nMathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's\nGPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain\nframework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official\ncurriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching\nplan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess\nthe generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic\nTextual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified\nthrough a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method. The results\ndemonstrate that RAG-based pipelines significantly outperform non-grounded\nprompting methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and\nfactual validity. The study further analyzes the trade-offs between the ease of\nimplementation of framework-based RAG and the fine-grained control offered by a\nmanual pipeline. This work presents a validated methodology for generating\ncurriculum-specific educational content in a low-resource language, introduces\na symbiotic RAG-QA evaluation technique, and provides actionable insights for\nthe development and deployment of practical EdTech solutions in Malaysia and\nsimilar regions."}

However, there\nexists an inherent trade-off: imposing a distinctive style often degrades\ntruthfulness. Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting\nstyle signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the\nmodel's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer\ncorrectness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse.\nWe attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions\nin certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that\npreserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates\nthe style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation\nspace via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables\nindependent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing\ninterference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each\nsubspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to\nmaintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness. We validate our method on\nmultiple styles and languages. Extensive experiments and analyses show that\nStyliTruth significantly reduces stylization-induced truthfulness collapse and\noutperforms existing inference-time intervention methods in balancing style\nadherence with truthfulness."}

To simultaneously\naddress both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample\nReplay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient\nanti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices\nunder GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced\nactivation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin\n(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.\nWe are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general\nreplay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general\ncapabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.\nIndeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter.

Stakeholder-Informed Feedback and Survey on Counterspeech", "comment": null, "summary": "Counterspeech, i.e. the practice of responding to online hate speech, has\ngained traction in NLP as a promising intervention. While early work emphasised\ncollaboration with non-governmental organisation stakeholders, recent research\ntrends have shifted toward automated pipelines that reuse a small set of legacy\ndatasets, often without input from affected communities. This paper presents a\nsystematic review of 74 NLP studies on counterspeech, analysing the extent to\nwhich stakeholder participation influences dataset creation, model development,\nand evaluation. To complement this analysis, we conducted a participatory case\nstudy with five NGOs specialising in online Gender-Based Violence (oGBV),\nidentifying stakeholder-informed practices for counterspeech generation.

Work in progress", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation\nwhen processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant\ninformation in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory\nrecall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs'\ncapabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active\nContext Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working\nmemory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three\ncategories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore,\nand (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage\ntheir attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus\non relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental\nevaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and\nNeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly\nimproves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent\ntool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context\nManagement, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also\nprovides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse\nlong-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies,\nrather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale."}

However, continual fine-tuning\nLLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,\ncharacterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and\n2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously\naddress both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample\nReplay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient\nanti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices\nunder GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced\nactivation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin\n(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.\nWe are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general\nreplay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general\ncapabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.\nIndeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled\nexperiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies\nunder the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via\nKL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that\nTM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work\npaves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future.
