In effect, such architectures state how the database records and\nlinks (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical\nexpression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it\nhard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available\ndata to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for\nexplaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where\nexplanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database\nthat mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global\nabductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash,\nSegoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between\ndeterminacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of\ngranularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones\nhighlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of\ntuples, and so on.

This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial\ncoordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and\nadaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative\nonline search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and\nteam members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and\ncoordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by\nmeasuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements\nwithin shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136\nparticipants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.\nResults show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while\nadaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,\nsuggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal\ndynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over\ntime. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in\nrole-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive\nstrategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support\nsystems."}

Then,\nwe argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from\nmistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating\nexecution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to\nsolve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute\nsignificantly more turns even when small models have 100\\% single-turn\naccuracy.

In contrast,\nrecent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer\ntasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on\nthe length of task they can execute in a single turn.

First two authors contributed\n  equally", "summary": "The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language\nunderstanding has made them increasingly popular in mental health research.\nWhile many studies explore LLMs' capabilities in emotion recognition, a\ncritical gap remains in evaluating whether LLMs align with human emotions at a\nfine-grained level. Existing research typically focuses on classifying emotions\ninto predefined, limited categories, overlooking more nuanced expressions. To\naddress this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit\ncommunities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our\ncomprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and\ndecomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories,\nenabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under\nvarious prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align\nwith human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis\nfurther shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with\nestablished emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture\ncontextual cues as effectively as human self-disclosures. These findings\nhighlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer\ninsights for future research aimed at enhancing their contextual understanding."}

Using the Population\nHealth Metrics Research Consortium (PHMRC) dataset across three age categories\n(Adult: 7,580; Child: 1,960; Neonate: 2,438), we evaluate multiple approaches:\nGPT-5 predictions, LCVA baseline, text embeddings, and meta-learner ensembles.\nOur results demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves the highest individual performance\nwith average test site accuracies of 48.6% (Adult), 50.5% (Child), and 53.5%\n(Neonate), outperforming traditional statistical machine learning baselines by\n5-10%.

Most existing methods typically\nfine-tune these agents independently, leading to capability gaps among them\nwith poor coordination. To address this, we propose MOAT, a Multi-Agent Joint\nAlignment Tuning framework that improves agents collaboration through iterative\nalignment. MOAT alternates between two key stages: (1) Planning Agent\nAlignment, which optimizes the planning agent to generate subgoal sequences\nthat better guide the grounding agent; and (2) Grounding Agent Improving, which\nfine-tunes the grounding agent using diverse subgoal-action pairs generated by\nthe agent itself to enhance its generalization capablity. Theoretical analysis\nproves that MOAT ensures a non-decreasing and progressively convergent training\nprocess. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that MOAT outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 3.1% on held-in\ntasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks."}

In theory, the\ncombination of causal self-attention and multilayer perceptron layers allows\nevery token to access and compute information based on all preceding tokens. In\npractice, to what extent are such operations present? In this paper, on mental\nmath tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without\nexplicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting\ninput-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes\nof information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and\nforcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.\nWith two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and\nAttention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with\nhigh accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful\ncomputation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last\ntoken, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle\nlayers. Experiments on a variety of models and arithmetic expressions show that\nthis subgraph is sufficient and necessary for high model performance, transfers\nacross different models, and works on a variety of input styles. Ablations on\ndifferent CAMA and ABP alternatives reveal their unique advantages over other\nmethods, which may be of independent interest."}

To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven\nExploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense\nof curiosity to guide exploration. We formalize curiosity with signals from\nboth the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its\ngenerated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates\nfrom a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus\nwithin the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows\nthat the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and\npromotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the\ncritic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.\nEmpirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over\nstandard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks. Further analysis identifies a\ncalibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM\nfailure modes."}
