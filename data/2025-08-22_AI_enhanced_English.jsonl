Notably,\neach behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,\nor magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at\ninference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as\npositive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and\nrejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.\nThis co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the\noutput space, characterized by well-separated response distributions\ncorresponding to each safety mode.

Existing static\ncaching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase by\npreloading entry points and multi-hop neighbors, but they fail in the second\nphase where query-dependent nodes must be dynamically accessed to achieve high\nrecall. We propose GoVector, an I/O-efficient caching strategy tailored for\ndisk-based graph indices. GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores\nentry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that\nadaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search\nphase. To further align storage layout with similarity-driven search patterns,\nGoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the\nsame or adjacent pages, thereby improving locality and reducing I/O overhead.\nExtensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that GoVector achieves\nsubstantial performance improvements.

A substantial portion of SLMs' memory\nfootprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and\nlanguage modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static\nvocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,\none-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage\nand a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles\nunderlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,\nthe observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any\nsingle inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between\nvocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce\nVocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that\naddresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a\nhybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling\non-demand loading of vocabulary components.

We conduct a controlled study that scales the\nlanguage model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and\noptimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,\nformalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce\nthis complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so\nfurther growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A\nword-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce\ncross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most\nfrequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and\noutput embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance\nreverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers\nfrom imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in\ndownstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact.

Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or\nrely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world\nclinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for\nradiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six\nclinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications\nthat explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group\nRelative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)\nSub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically\nchallenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided\nAdvantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt\ndifficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable\nmore stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.\nExperiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior\noffline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while\nremaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.\nCode will be released upon publication."}

Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,\nbut their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor\nfeedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce\nDeep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement\nlearning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for\nmedical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical\nretrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge\nsources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More\ncrutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its\nenvironment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,\nand diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from\nlarge-scale data through RL.\n  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework\nconsistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches\nacross multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves\nsubstantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic\nbaselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks\nfor both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and\nretrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the\nuniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional\nimplementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight\nimprovements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight\ninto its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more\nreliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

However, they often fall\nshort in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)\nhas emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning\nprocess. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning\nability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the\nmodel's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We\nintroduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse\nreasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various\ndomains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost\n(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning\nefficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models\nconsistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and\nnon-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as\nevidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more\nstreamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of\nTIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks."}

While the Model Context Protocol\n(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is\na significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve\nmulti-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In\nthis work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated\nreal-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,\nthat require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file\noperations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a\nnovel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather\nthan raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world\nenvironments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate\nbelow 60\\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed\nablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and\ninefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing\ncurrent models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world\nagent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably\nexecute complex tasks through tool use."}
