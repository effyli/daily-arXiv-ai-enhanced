To do so, LLM model providers\noffer multiple LLMs with different sizes, spanning various cost-quality\ntrade-offs when processing text at scale. Top-of-the-line LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o,\nClaude Sonnet) operate with high accuracy but are prohibitively expensive when\nprocessing many records. To avoid high costs, more affordable but lower quality\nLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku) can be used to process records, but we\nneed to ensure that the overall accuracy does not deviate substantially from\nthat of the top-of-the-line LLMs. The model cascade framework provides a\nblueprint to manage this trade-off, by using the confidence of LLMs in their\noutput (e.g., log-probabilities) to decide on which records to use the\naffordable LLM. However, existing solutions following this framework provide\nonly marginal cost savings and weak theoretical guarantees because of poor\nestimation of the quality of the affordable LLM's outputs. We present BARGAIN,\na method that judiciously uses affordable LLMs in data processing to\nsignificantly reduce cost while providing strong theoretical guarantees on the\nsolution quality. BARGAIN employs a novel adaptive sampling strategy and\nstatistical estimation procedure that uses data and task characteristics and\nbuilds on recent statistical tools to make accurate estimations with tight\ntheoretical guarantees. Variants of BARGAIN can support guarantees on accuracy,\nprecision, or recall of the output. Experimental results across 8 real-world\ndatasets show that BARGAIN reduces cost, on average, by up to 86% more than\nstate-of-the-art, while providing stronger theoretical guarantees on accuracy\nof output, with similar gains when guaranteeing a desired level of precision or\nrecall."}

Pre-training broke the symmetry among\ntokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as\ninferred from the presented token confusion matrix.

Despite its\nsignificance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access\nto educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social\nexclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend\non Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although\ncertain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for\nindividuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent\nrequirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially\nfor Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions\nhave primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a\nconsiderable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,\nspecifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of\nisolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of\ncontinuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research\nrepresents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we\nintroduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL,\nfocusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable\nsophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation.\nAdditionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained\nResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with\nBidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\\% accuracy at\nsigner dependent mode and 77.71\\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This\ndevelopment leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL\ncommunity but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign\nlanguage."}

In this paper, a novel approach to agent\ndesign and agent learning ispresented with the context of reinforcement\nlearning. A model of deep learning is first applied toprocess game text and\nbuild a world model. Next, the agent is learned through a policy gradient-based\ndeep reinforcement learning method to facilitate conversion from state value to\noptimal policy.The enhanced agent works better in several text-based game\nexperiments and significantlysurpasses previous agents on game completion ratio\nand win rate. Our study introduces novelunderstanding and empirical ground for\nusing reinforcement learning for text games and sets thestage for developing\nand optimizing reinforcement learning agents for more general domains\nandproblems."}

However,\nmost work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic\nsince other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world\nproblems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs'\ninductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and\nsynthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example\nconsists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for\nthe intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under\nthe incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new\nmetric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We\nevaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs\ncan perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle\nwith complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with\npopular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR."}

This work\nintroduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment,\nwith all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces\nthe notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents\nperceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control\nof information.

We anticipate that this\nconcept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information\nniches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency."}
