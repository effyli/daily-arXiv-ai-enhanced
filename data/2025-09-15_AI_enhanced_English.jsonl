Methods: Drafting times for IND nonclinical written\nsummaries (eCTD modules 2.6.2, 2.6.4, 2.6.6) generated by AutoIND were directly\nrecorded. For comparison, manual drafting times for IND summaries previously\ncleared by the U.S. FDA were estimated from the experience of regulatory\nwriters ($\\geq$6 years) and used as industry-standard benchmarks. Quality was\nassessed by a blinded regulatory writing assessor using seven pre-specified\ncategories: correctness, completeness, conciseness, consistency, clarity,\nredundancy, and emphasis. Each sub-criterion was scored 0-3 and normalized to a\npercentage. A critical regulatory error was defined as any misrepresentation or\nomission likely to alter regulatory interpretation (e.g., incorrect NOAEL,\nomission of mandatory GLP dose-formulation analysis). Results: AutoIND reduced\ninitial drafting time by $\\sim$97% (from $\\sim$100 h to 3.7 h for 18,870\npages/61 reports in IND-1; and to 2.6 h for 11,425 pages/58 reports in IND-2).\nQuality scores were 69.6\\% and 77.9\\% for IND-1 and IND-2. No critical\nregulatory errors were detected, but deficiencies in emphasis, conciseness, and\nclarity were noted. Conclusions: AutoIND can dramatically accelerate IND\ndrafting, but expert regulatory writers remain essential to mature outputs to\nsubmission-ready quality. Systematic deficiencies identified provide a roadmap\nfor targeted model improvements."}

Current\nmethods treat this as a pattern recognition task over long conversation logs,\nleading to critically low step-level accuracy (below 17\\%), which renders them\nimpractical for debugging complex systems. Their core weakness is a fundamental\ninability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if\ncorrecting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To\nbridge this counterfactual inference gap, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P)\nScaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from\npattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly\nguides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process\nwithin a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes\nbehind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective\nintervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and\nverify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach\nleverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a\nrigorous causal logic on the model's analysis. Our extensive experiments on the\nWho\\&When benchmark demonstrate its efficacy.

In response,\nanalyses of social media (SM) language have gained prominence due to their high\ntemporal resolution and longitudinal scope. Here, we introduce a method to\ndetermine the timing of users' diagnoses and apply it to study language\ntrajectories from 3 years before to 21 years after BD diagnosis - contrasted\nwith uses reporting unipolar depression (UD) and non-affected users (HC). We\nshow that BD diagnosis is accompanied by pervasive linguistic alterations\nreflecting mood disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse,\nhospitalization, medical comorbidities, unusual thought content, and\ndisorganized thought. We further observe recurring mood-related language\nchanges across two decades after the diagnosis, with a pronounced 12-month\nperiodicity suggestive of seasonal mood episodes. Finally, trend-level evidence\nsuggests an increased periodicity in users estimated to be female. In sum, our\nfindings provide evidence for language alterations in the acute and chronic\nphase of BD. This validates and extends recent efforts leveraging SM for\nscalable monitoring of mental health."}

This level of categorization enables a comparative\nanalysis of how supportive responses vary across lower and higher stakes\ncontexts. Our analysis reveals that LLMs are more prone to unrealistic\npositivity through dismissive and minimizing tone, particularly in high-stakes\ncontexts.

However, deduction does not always imply\nlearning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the\nmodels rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue\nthat, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full\ncharacterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale\nanalysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,\ndistributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an\neffective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise\nto unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more\nnumerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt\nstyle, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from\nregularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity,\nespecially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought.

Previous work has tried to reduce the overhead by pruning and\nmerging experts, but primarily focused on expert-level operations, leaving\nneuron-level structure underexplored. We propose DERN (Dropping Experts,\nRecombining Neurons), a task-agnostic and retraining-free framework for expert\npruning and reconstruction. We observe that experts are often misaligned and\ncontain semantic conflicts at the neuron level, which poses challenges for\ndirect merging. To solve this, DERN works in three steps: it first prunes\nredundant experts using router statistics; then it decomposes them into\nneuron-level expert segments, assigning each segment to its most compatible\nretained expert; and finally, it merges segments within each retained expert to\nbuild a compact representation. Experiments on Mixtral, Qwen, and DeepSeek SMoE\nmodels show that DERN improves performance by more than 5% on commonsense\nreasoning and MMLU benchmarks under 50% expert sparsity, without extra\ntraining.
