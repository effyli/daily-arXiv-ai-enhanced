Following\nheuristic-based \"Think step by step\" approaches, the field has evolved in two\nmain directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit\nimproved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent\nline of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,\ntailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we\nintroduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these\napproaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the\nprompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is\nbeing iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When\ncoupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a \"good\"\nprompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us\nto train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for\nthe problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.", "AI": {"tldr": "TRPrompt unifies heuristic-based and reward-based prompt optimization methods, using textual feedback to train a prompt model without prior datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in math problem datasets.", "motivation": "To improve prompt optimization for LLMs by integrating textual feedback into training, combining existing approaches for better performance.", "method": "Introducing the TRPrompt framework that directly incorporates textual rewards into prompt training, iteratively refining prompts without prior datasets.", "result": "TRPrompt effectively generates high-quality, query-specific prompts, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.", "conclusion": "The framework demonstrates that textual reward-based prompt training enhances LLM reasoning, offering a unified, training-free approach with strong empirical results."}}
