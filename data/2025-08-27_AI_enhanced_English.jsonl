Departing from current transformer-based language models, which\noperate on statistical next-token prediction, we explore a model in which\nmeaning is not inferred probabilistically but formed through recursive\ntensorial transformation. Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit\n\\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling\nirony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a\nsemantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical\ncomputation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward\nstability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,\ntensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a\nmodel of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,\nbut also philosophically significant. We argue that true meaning emerges not\nfrom simulation, but from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, and\nthat this requires a fundamentally new kind of cognitive architecture -- one\ndesigned to shape language, not just predict it."}

(2) Long-term Memory:\nAgents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal\nexperiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent\nmemory system.

Drawing from a case study\nin historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines\nusing NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over\npreprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our\niterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality\nreduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised\nthrough parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and\ncoverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic\nclustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the\nlimitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the\nimportance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological\ntriangulation in computational discourse studies.

In\nthis work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple\ncollectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective\naction in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals,\ni.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of\nthe features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We\nprovide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives'\nsizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing\nprevious empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with\nmultiple collectives."}

A Systematic Study of Knowledge Boundary Perception in LVLMs", "comment": "EMNLP2025 Findings", "summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question\nanswering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model\nshould perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does\nnot. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by\nevaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer\nconsistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three\nLVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable\nperception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three\nconfidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable\nindicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To\nenhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration\nmethods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.\nAdditionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that\njointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering\nperformance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level\ncompared to LLMs."}

Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's\ndecisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as\nbeliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles\nemerges from these differences, highlighting that \"style\" is an essential but\noften overlooked dimension of intelligence.\n  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing\nand analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines\nits foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical\nperspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,\nwe construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction\nloop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On\nthis basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable\nindicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.\n  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and\nmeasuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized\nstate spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive\nbalance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement\nlearning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific\nstylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style\nlearning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential\nof these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive\nentertainment.\n  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of\nstyle as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI)."}

While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for\nassisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic\nbenchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches\nsystematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in\nthese tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of\nexisting benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a\nselective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation\nsurfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden\nwhen relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing\nframework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in\nscientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that\nyields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model\nparameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2)\nReasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context\non top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning\nimproves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge.

However, most systems remain constrained by a linear\nrequest-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in\nmulti-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm\nin which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces\n(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework\nleverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative\nrefinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic\nevaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares\ngenerative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,\ninteraction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and\nemotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces\nconsistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in\nover 70% of cases.
