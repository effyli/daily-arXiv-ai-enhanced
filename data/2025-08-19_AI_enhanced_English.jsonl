For slower external storage devices, such as HDD\nand SATA SSD, the scan performance is primarily limited by the I/O bandwidth\n(i.e., I/O bound) due to the substantial read/write amplifications in\nLSM-Trees. Recent adoption of high-performance storage devices, such as NVMe\nSSD, has transformed the main limitation to be compute-bound, emerging the\nimpact of computational resource consumption caused by inefficient compactions\nand filtering. However, when the value size increases, the bottleneck for scan\nperformance in fast devices gradually shifts towards the I/O bandwidth as well,\nand the overall throughput across all types of devices undergo a dramatic\nreduction. This paper addresses the core issues by proposing LSM-OPD, a Log-S\ntructured M erge-O rder- Preserving Dictionary encoding scheme that enables\ndirect computing on compressed data within LSM-Trees. It first enables\nkey-value-separated data flushing to disk in a densely encoded columnar layout,\nideally with few bytes for a large string value (e.g., 1024 bytes), thereby\nsignificantly alleviating the frequent I/O requests caused by intensive scans.\nThen, it is capable of offloading the costly scan-based operations on large\nvalues, including compaction and value filtering, to lightweight dictionaries\ndue to the order-preserving property. And SIMD-based vectorization can now be\nemployed to maximize the evaluating performance on modern multi-core\nprocessors, further breaking the compute-bound limitations in LSM-trees.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency of LSM-OPD in\nprocessing various workloads that involve intensive scan-based operations on\ndiverse modern storage devices."}

By integrating a transport-guided\nmatching mechanism with a geometric volume minimization objective (GAVE), MOVER\nencourages consistent alignment across all modalities in a modality-agnostic\nmanner. Experiments on text-video-audio retrieval tasks demonstrate that MOVER\nsignificantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot and\nfinetuned settings.

Our\nexperiments show that models generally perform poorly on this benchmark, and\nthat increased model size or capability does not consistently lead to better\nperformance. These results suggest a fundamental limitation in how LLMs\nrepresent and reason about their own behavior."}

With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal\ndata analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these\nphenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims\nto identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation\nevents.

These causal models\nare built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us\nto infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal\ngraphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step\nto infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal\nmodels. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional\ndistributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation,\nthis framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular\ndynamic systems.

Although considerable\neffort has been dedicated to aligning LLMs with human moral values, existing\nbenchmarks and evaluations remain largely superficial, typically measuring\nalignment based on final ethical verdicts rather than explicit moral reasoning.\nIn response, this paper aims to advance the investigation of LLMs' moral\ncapabilities by examining their capacity to function as Artificial Moral\nAssistants (AMAs), systems envisioned in the philosophical literature to\nsupport human moral deliberation. We assert that qualifying as an AMA requires\nmore than what state-of-the-art alignment techniques aim to achieve: not only\nmust AMAs be able to discern ethically problematic situations, they should also\nbe able to actively reason about them, navigating between conflicting values\noutside of those embedded in the alignment phase. Building on existing\nphilosophical literature, we begin by designing a new formal framework of the\nspecific kind of behaviour an AMA should exhibit, individuating key qualities\nsuch as deductive and abductive moral reasoning. Drawing on this theoretical\nframework, we develop a benchmark to test these qualities and evaluate popular\nopen LLMs against it. Our results reveal considerable variability across models\nand highlight persistent shortcomings, particularly regarding abductive moral\nreasoning. Our work connects theoretical philosophy with practical AI\nevaluation while also emphasising the need for dedicated strategies to\nexplicitly enhance moral reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Code available at\nhttps://github.com/alessioGalatolo/AMAeval"}

CRED-SQL\nfirst performs cluster-based large-scale schema retrieval to pinpoint the\ntables and columns most relevant to a given NLQ, alleviating schema mismatch.\nIt then introduces an intermediate natural language representation-Execution\nDescription Language (EDL)-to bridge the gap between NLQs and SQL. This\nreformulation decomposes the task into two stages: Text-to-EDL and EDL-to-SQL,\nleveraging LLMs' strong general reasoning capabilities while reducing semantic\ndeviation. Extensive experiments on two large-scale, cross-domain\nbenchmarks-SpiderUnion and BirdUnion-demonstrate that CRED-SQL achieves new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating its effectiveness and\nscalability.

We present the first comprehensive\ncausal study of this phenomenon by analyzing and directly intervening in the\ninternal representation geometry of large language models (LLMs). Our key\ncontribution is an online variational probing framework that continuously\nestimates the subspace of the standard variety during fine-tuning, enabling\nprojection-based decoupling from this space.

There has been a\nsubstantial body of research developing models for determining if a social\nmedia post is abusive or not; however, this research has primarily focused on\nexploiting social media posts individually, overlooking additional context that\ncan be derived from surrounding posts. In this study, we look at conversational\nexchanges, where a user replies to an earlier post by another user (the parent\ntweet). We ask: does leveraging context from the parent tweet help determine if\na reply post is abusive or not, and what are the features that contribute the\nmost? We study a range of content-based and account-based features derived from\nthe context, and compare this to the more widely studied approach of only\nlooking at the features from the reply tweet. For a more generalizable study,\nwe test four different classification models on a dataset made of\nconversational exchanges (parent-reply tweet pairs) with replies labeled as\nabusive or not. Our experiments show that incorporating contextual features\nleads to substantial improvements compared to the use of features derived from\nthe reply tweet only, confirming the importance of leveraging context. We\nobserve that, among the features under study, it is especially the\ncontent-based features (what is being posted) that contribute to the\nclassification performance rather than account-based features (who is posting\nit).

In this paper, we\nobserve that current causal and diffusion models encounter difficulties in\nproblems that require adaptive token generation orders to solve tractably,\nwhich we characterize with the $\\mathcal{V}$-information framework. Motivated\nby this, we propose Reinforced Context Order Recovery (ReCOR), a\nreinforcement-learning-based framework to extract adaptive, data-dependent\ntoken generation orders from text data without annotations. Self-supervised by\ntoken prediction statistics, ReCOR estimates the hardness of predicting every\nunfilled token and adaptively selects the next token during both training and\ninference. Experiments on challenging reasoning and planning datasets\ndemonstrate the superior performance of ReCOR compared with baselines,\nsometimes outperforming oracle models supervised with the ground-truth order."}

While large language\nmodels (LLMs) have shown promise as autonomous agents in simulated IR settings,\ntheir reasoning is often limited by a lack of access to external knowledge. In\nthis work, we present AutoBnB-RAG, an extension of the AutoBnB framework that\nincorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into multi-agent incident\nresponse simulations. Built on the Backdoors & Breaches (B&B) tabletop game\nenvironment, AutoBnB-RAG enables agents to issue retrieval queries and\nincorporate external evidence during collaborative investigations. We introduce\ntwo retrieval settings: one grounded in curated technical documentation\n(RAG-Wiki), and another using narrative-style incident reports (RAG-News). We\nevaluate performance across eight team structures, including newly introduced\nargumentative configurations designed to promote critical reasoning. To\nvalidate practical utility, we also simulate real-world cyber incidents based\non public breach reports, demonstrating AutoBnB-RAG's ability to reconstruct\ncomplex multi-stage attacks.

While prior work has\nexamined social and positional biases, the specific forms of bias pertinent to\ncontact center operations - which we term Operational Bias - have remained\nunexplored. To address this gap, we introduce BlindSpot, a framework built upon\na taxonomy of 15 operational bias dimensions (e.g., disfluency, speaker, topic)\nfor the identification and quantification of these biases. BlindSpot leverages\nan LLM as a zero-shot classifier to derive categorical distributions for each\nbias dimension in a pair of transcript and its summary. The bias is then\nquantified using two metrics: Fidelity Gap (the JS Divergence between\ndistributions) and Coverage (the percentage of source labels omitted). Using\nBlindSpot, we conducted an empirical study with 2500 real call transcripts and\ntheir summaries generated by 20 LLMs of varying scales and families (e.g., GPT,\nLlama, Claude).

To bridge this gap, we present two\nkey contributions: (i) we introduce MuDRiC, an extended Arabic commonsense\ndataset incorporating multiple dialects, and (ii) a novel method adapting Graph\nConvolutional Networks (GCNs) to Arabic commonsense reasoning, which enhances\nsemantic relationship modeling for improved commonsense validation.

This has led to the\ndevelopment of separate thinking and non-thinking LLM variants, leaving the\nonus of selecting the optimal model for each query on the end user. In this\nwork, we introduce OptimalThinkingBench, a unified benchmark that jointly\nevaluates overthinking and underthinking in LLMs and also encourages the\ndevelopment of optimally-thinking models that balance performance and\nefficiency. Our benchmark comprises two sub-benchmarks: OverthinkingBench,\nfeaturing simple queries in 72 domains, and UnderthinkingBench, containing 11\nchallenging reasoning tasks. Using novel thinking-adjusted accuracy metrics, we\nperform extensive evaluation of 33 different thinking and non-thinking models\nand show that no model is able to optimally think on our benchmark. Thinking\nmodels often overthink for hundreds of tokens on the simplest user queries\nwithout improving performance. In contrast, large non-thinking models\nunderthink, often falling short of much smaller thinking models.

In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark\nmore reliable for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality\nevaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in\ncurrent benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models\nfrom worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability\nbetween training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better\nsignal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale,\nand those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These\nresults suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful\nbenchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect\nsignal or noise. For example, we propose that switching to a metric that has\nbetter signal and noise (e.g., perplexity rather than accuracy) leads to better\nreliability and improved scaling law error. We also find that filtering noisy\nsubtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable\nmulti-task evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's\nintermediate checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements. We\nconclude by recommending that those creating new benchmarks, or selecting which\nexisting benchmarks to use, aim for high signal and low noise. We use 30\nbenchmarks for these experiments, and 375 open-weight language models from 60M\nto 32B parameters, resulting in a new, publicly available dataset of 900K\nevaluation benchmark results, totaling 200M instances."}

Although existing\ndetection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD)\nscenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to\nfeatures used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of\nLLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively\ncapture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between\nLLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this\nhypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural\nactivation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we\npropose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method.\nSpecifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of\nLGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better\nidentify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of\nthe text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a\nprecomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms\nall baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD\nscenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and\nmainstream attacks.
